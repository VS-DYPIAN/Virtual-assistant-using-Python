# 👾 VIRTUAL-ASSISTANT 👾

### 🔶 One of my best completely self-built from scratch projects 🔶

>### This Project is the Virtual Assistant that's been created by using Libraries and end-to-end Customization

### ***`"Dypian"`*** is the name of my Assistant and does whatever you ask her to do!!

<br>

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION ✅

Once the program is run, the microphone gets activated to listen to the voice commands.
The assistant gets activated only when the name assigned to her is called, otherwise it doesn’t respond.
Once the assistant is activated a number of tasks can be performed by her all with you’re voice like,

### As every Assistant out there it does the following :
📅 Date, time and day can be asked.\
🔎 Search the web.\
🔓 Open various apps, sites.\
⏰ Sets a Reminder.\
📝 Open Word and write in it all with your voice.\
📰 Read out the latest news from NDTV without even opening it.\
🎼 Change the assistant's voice as per wish.\
😜 Crack some jokes.

## 🧊 WORKING 🧊

### When the program executes the mic is enabled and is waiting for the user’s input for the name of the assistant to activate it. There are three possible outcomes:
***✒️  If no input, assistant asks politely for input***
\
***✒️ If the input is wrong, assistant reminds the user to call out it’s name***
\
***✒️ If the input is correct the assistant is activated*** 

<br>

### 💡 Now when the assistant is activated there is a list of functions available for use.  For Ex. : 


 ### ***📌 When the user asks for date, day or time :*** 
   Assistant replies to the user accordingly getting real time values with hardcoded name of days.


 ### ***📌 When the user asks for a reminder to be set :***
   Assistant asks what to remind and will remind the user at the specified time with the specified reason. Assistant also uses a system notification sent for reminding.


### ***📌 When the user asks to use a word :***
   Assistant opens a word file and does real time typing while the user is talking excluding the words like bold, italics, underline, centre. left, right align while providing    functions for the same.


### ***📌 When the user asks for latest news updates :***
   Assistant web scraps NDTV.com in the background for the latest news and prints it on the output panel of the IDE with a link provided for the same.


### ***📌 When the user asks for a web search :***
   Assistant searches the web for the same and opens the browser for us.


### ***📌 When the user asks for help in python :***
   Assistant gives the user a choice of three websites commonly used for programming related doubts. According to the user’s wish the assistant opens the chosen website.


### ***📌 When the user asks for some jokes :***
   Assistant gets jokes from a dataset of more than 60,000 jokes and speaks it out and after every joke accesses a .mp3 file in the computer directory for a crowd laughing effect.
